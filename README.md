[Write On Frontend](https://github.com/TimothyAllgood/writr_frontend)

Write On is a simple React app that pulls writing prompts from the WritingPrompts subreddit to help aspiring writers with creative writing. It allows users to create and account, login, and start writing. Users can save their stories to a MongoDB collection, or save them locally as .txt, .pdf, or .doc files. Users may view other users accounts, and the stories they have created as well.

## Tech Used
The CRUD GraphQL APi was build using Node.js and Express. The database is MongoDB.
